# Introduction

**js-math-tools** is a little library of (you guessed it) math tools for JS. It was built completely from scratch and has no other dependencies (though it does have some dependencies for bundling, linting, testing, etc.).

# Installation

For client-side use, attach the `dist/js-math-tools.js` file to your web page.

Using a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@jrc03c/js-math-tools/dist/js-math-tools.js"></script>
```

Or installing via NPM:

```bash
npm install --save https://github.com/jrc03c/js-math-tools
```

```html
<script src="node_modules/@jrc03c/js-math-tools/dist/js-math-tools.js"></script>
```

To use in Node, install via NPM, and then import it:

```js
const tools = require("js-math-tools")
```

# Usage

You can either pull individual functions out, like:

```js
const { add } = require("js-math-tools")
add(3, 4) // 7
```

Or, for easier access, you can "dump" all of the functions into the global scope:

```js
require("js-math-tools").dump()
add(3, 4) // 7
```

# API

## `abs(x)`

Returns the absolute value(s) of `x`.

## `add(a, b, c, ...)`

Returns the sum of the given values. See the note below `sum` to read about the differences between `add` and `sum`.

## `apply(x, fn)`

Applies the function `fn` to `x`.

Note that (when `x` is an array, `Series`, or `DataFrame`) this function uses slightly different behavior than [`Array.prototype.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). When a function is passed into an array's `map` method, that function is applied to every item at the shallowest level of the array. So, for example, if the array is 2-dimensional, then the `map` method would apply a function to each child array in the parent array. But the `apply` function doesn't quite work that way; instead, it applies a function on each item in an arbitrarily nested array, regardless of depth. In that sense, the function passed into the `apply` function will never be given an array as an argument; it can be passed any other data type, but _not_ an array.

For example, when using an array's `map` method, we can get information about each child array, like its length.

```js
const x = [[100], [200, 300], [400, 500, 600]]
const lengths = x.map(row => row.length)
console.log(lengths)
// [1, 2, 3]
```

But this won't work when using `apply` because child arrays will never be passed into the given function. If we try to run the same thing again using the `apply` function, we'll get results that are perhaps unexpected:

```js
const x = [[100], [200, 300], [400, 500, 600]]
const lengths = apply(x, row => row.length)
console.log(lengths)
// [
//   [undefined],
//   [undefined, undefined],
//   [undefined, undefined, undefined],
// ]
```

That's because `apply` is trying to pass numbers into the given function, not arrays. Here's an example that uses `apply` correctly:

```js
const x = [[100], [200, 300], [400, 500, 600]]
const y = apply(x, v => v * 2)
console.log(y)
// [
//   [200],
//   [400, 600],
//   [800, 1000, 1200],
// ]
```

## `arccos(x)`

Returns the inverse cosine(s) `x`.

## `arcsin(x)`

Returns the inverse sine(s) of `x`.

## `arctan(x)`

Returns the inverse tangent(s) of `x`.

## `argmax(x)`

Returns the index of the maximum value in `x`. If `x` is 1-dimensional, then a whole number will be returned. If, however, `x` is an arbitrarily nested array, then the returned value will be an array of whole numbers representing indices at each dimension. For example:

```js
const a = [1, 5, 3]
console.log(argmax(a))
// 1

const b = [
  [1, 5],
  [3, 4],
  [9, 2],
]

console.log(argmax(b))
// [2, 0]
// i.e., row 2, item 0

const c = [1, [2, 3, [4, 5, 6, [7, 8, 9, 10]]]]
console.log(argmax(c))
// [1, 2, 3, 3]
// i.e., row 1, sub-row 2, sub-sub-row 3, item 3
```

If `x` is a `Series`, then the returned value will be a string from the object's index (i.e., something akin to a "row" name, though a `Series` doesn't actually have rows). If `x` is a `DataFrame`, then the returned value will be an array of the form `[rowName, colName]`. To obtain numerical indices in either of these cases, just pass `x.values` into the `argmax` function rather than `x` itself.

## `argmin(x)`

Returns the index of the minimum value in `x`. See `argmax` for examples and more information about the returned values.

## `assert(condition, message)`

Does nothing if `condition` is true; otherwise, it throws an error with the (optional) given `message` string.

## `cast(x, type)`

Casts the given value `x` into the type `type`. Valid type values are:

- `"boolean"`
- `"date"`
- `"null"`
- `"number"`
- `"object"`
- `"string"`

If `x` is an array, then the values _within_ the array are cast into the given type; i.e., the array itself is not cast. Also note that trying to cast a non-number as a number will return `NaN`; but for all other types, failure to cast will return `null`. For example, `cast("hello", "number")` will return `NaN`, but `cast("hello", "boolean")` will return `null`.

## `ceil(x)`

Returns the ceiling(s) of `x`.

## `chop(x, threshold=1e-10)`

Returns 0(s) if the absolute value(s) of `x` is less than the `threshold`; otherwise, it returns `x`.

## `clamp(x, min, max)`

Returns `min` if `x` is less than `min`; returns `max` if `x` is greater than `max`; otherwise, returns `x`.

## `combinations(x, r)`

Returns all possible combinations of `r` items from `x`. Note that any nesting of `x` will be ignored — i.e., `x` will be "flattened" into a 1-dimensional array before getting the combinations — so it won't be possible with this function to get combinations of _arrays_.

## `copy(x)`

Returns a copy of `x`. The only exception is if `x` is an instance of a custom class. In such a case, a plain JavaScript `Object` will be returned, though bearing the same members as `x` but not an instance of the same class. Also, this function handles circular references by replacing them with strings like `"<reference to '/some/path/down/into/the/object'>"`. If you need a copy of `x` using a custom class, use [`structuredClone`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone).

## `correl(a, b)`

Returns the correlation of `a` and `b`, which are 1-dimensional arrays or `Series` instances.

## `cos(x)`

Returns the cosine(s) of `x`.

## `count(x, matcher)`

Returns the number(s) of times that certain values appear in `x`. If `matcher` is a single value (like a number), then the returned value will be a single number (indicating the number of times that `matcher` appears in `x`). If `matcher` is an array, then an array of the same size will be returned containing objects with `value` and `count` properties. If `matcher` is a function, then a single number will be returned based on how many times the function returned `true` when presented with each value in `x`. Finally, if `matcher` is undefined, then all of the items in `x` will be counted and returned as an array of objects with `value` and `count` properties.

## `covariance(a, b)`

Returns the covariance between `a` and `b`, which are 1-dimensional arrays or `Series` instances.

<hr />

## `DataFrame(x)`

The `DataFrame` class is similar to pandas' [`DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). They at least represent the same kind of data (2-dimensional arrays with row and column names), though they probably differ in many of their members.

The constructor for a `DataFrame` can optionally receive a value `x`, which can be any of these:

- another `DataFrame`
- a 2-dimensional array
- an object whose key-value pairs represent column names and column values, respectively

> **NOTE:** Unlike the pandas `DataFrame` class, this `DataFrame` class doesn't have any methods for reading from or writing to CSV files. I recommend using [papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/) if you need that functionality because it's very robust.

### `DataFrame.values`

A 2-dimensional array containing the values held by the DataFrame. Technically, `values` is a getter-setter pair that stores its data in a hidden `_values` property. While it's possible to set the `_values` property directly, this is strongly discouraged because it bypasses sanity checks on the data, like checking that new data is 2-dimensional, etc.

### `DataFrame.columns`

An array of column names. Technically, `columns` is a getter-setter pair that stores its data in a hidden `_columns` property. While it's possible to set the `_columns` property directly, this is strongly discouraged because it bypasses sanity checks on the data, like checking to make sure that the length of a new columns array is the same length as the rows in the `values` array, etc.

### `DataFrame.index`

An array of row names. Technically, `index` is a getter-setter pair that stores its data in a hidden `_index` property. While it's possible to set the `_index` property directly, this is strongly discouraged because it bypasses sanity checks on the data, like checking to make sure that the length of the new rows array is the same as the length of the `values` array, etc.

### `DataFrame.rows`

Identical to `DataFrame.index`.

### `DataFrame.shape`

A read-only array with 2 values representing the number of rows and number of columns, respectively, in the `values` array.

### `DataFrame.length`

A read-only value representing the number of rows in the `DataFrame`.

### `DataFrame.width`

A read-only value representing the number of columns in the `DataFrame`.

### `DataFrame.isEmpty`

A read-only boolean value that is `true` if the `DataFrame` contains no data or `false` otherwise.

### `DataFrame.T`

Identical to `DataFrame.transpose` except that `T` is a getter.

### `DataFrame.append(x, axis=0)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` with `x` appended to it. Possible `axis` values are 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the row(s) of `x` should be stacked beneath the rows of the original `DataFrame`, and 1 indicates that the row(s) of `x` should be placed to the right of the rows of the original `DataFrame`. For example:

```js
const x = new DataFrame({ foo: [2, 3, 4], bar: [5, 6, 7] })
x.print()
// ┌─────────┬─────┬─────┐
// │ (index) │ foo │ bar │
// ├─────────┼─────┼─────┤
// │  row0   │  2  │  5  │
// │  row1   │  3  │  6  │
// │  row2   │  4  │  7  │
// └─────────┴─────┴─────┘
// Shape: [ 3, 2 ]

// append a vector with axis = 0
x.append(["a", "b", "c"], 0).print()
// ┌─────────┬─────┬─────┬───────────┐
// │ (index) │ foo │ bar │   col2    │
// ├─────────┼─────┼─────┼───────────┤
// │  row0   │  2  │  5  │ undefined │
// │  row1   │  3  │  6  │ undefined │
// │  row2   │  4  │  7  │ undefined │
// │  row3   │ 'a' │ 'b' │    'c'    │
// └─────────┴─────┴─────┴───────────┘
// Shape: [ 4, 3 ]

// append a vector with axis = 1
x.append(["a", "b", "c"], 1).print()
// ┌─────────┬─────┬─────┬──────┐
// │ (index) │ foo │ bar │ col2 │
// ├─────────┼─────┼─────┼──────┤
// │  row0   │  2  │  5  │ 'a'  │
// │  row1   │  3  │  6  │ 'b'  │
// │  row2   │  4  │  7  │ 'c'  │
// └─────────┴─────┴─────┴──────┘
// Shape: [ 3, 3 ]
```

So, if `x` is a vector, then it gets treated as a row if the `axis` is 0 or as a column if the `axis` is 1.

But working with matrices is slightly different:

```js
const x = new DataFrame({ foo: [2, 3, 4], bar: [5, 6, 7] })
x.print()
// ┌─────────┬─────┬─────┐
// │ (index) │ foo │ bar │
// ├─────────┼─────┼─────┤
// │  row0   │  2  │  5  │
// │  row1   │  3  │  6  │
// │  row2   │  4  │  7  │
// └─────────┴─────┴─────┘
// Shape: [ 3, 2 ]

// append a matrix with axis = 0
x.append([
  ["a", "b", "c"],
  ["d", "e", "f"],
]).print()
// ┌─────────┬─────┬─────┬───────────┐
// │ (index) │ foo │ bar │   col2    │
// ├─────────┼─────┼─────┼───────────┤
// │  row0   │  2  │  5  │ undefined │
// │  row1   │  3  │  6  │ undefined │
// │  row2   │  4  │  7  │ undefined │
// │  row3   │ 'a' │ 'b' │    'c'    │
// │  row4   │ 'd' │ 'e' │    'f'    │
// └─────────┴─────┴─────┴───────────┘
// Shape: [ 5, 3 ]

// append a matrix with axis = 1
x.append(
  [
    ["a", "b", "c"],
    ["d", "e", "f"],
  ],
  1
).print()
// ┌─────────┬─────┬─────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
// │ (index) │ foo │ bar │   col2    │   col3    │   col4    │
// ├─────────┼─────┼─────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┤
// │  row0   │  2  │  5  │    'a'    │    'b'    │    'c'    │
// │  row1   │  3  │  6  │    'd'    │    'e'    │    'f'    │
// │  row2   │  4  │  7  │ undefined │ undefined │ undefined │
// └─────────┴─────┴─────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
// Shape: [ 3, 5 ]
```

So, when appending vectors, the vector either gets treated as a row or transposed and treated as a column; but that transposition does _not_ occur with matrices: matrices either get stacked directly below or directly to the right, and in neither case are they transposed.

Finally, when appending `Series` or `DataFrame` objects, the method will try to place values in the correct column (if `axis` is 0) or row (if `axis` is 1) before tacking on new columns or rows. For example:

```js
const x = new DataFrame({ foo: [2, 3, 4], bar: [5, 6, 7] })
x.print()
// ┌─────────┬─────┬─────┐
// │ (index) │ foo │ bar │
// ├─────────┼─────┼─────┤
// │  row0   │  2  │  5  │
// │  row1   │  3  │  6  │
// │  row2   │  4  │  7  │
// └─────────┴─────┴─────┘
// Shape: [ 3, 2 ]

const y = new DataFrame({ bar: [10, 20, 30, 40], baz: [50, 60, 70, 80] })
y.print()
// ┌─────────┬─────┬─────┐
// │ (index) │ bar │ baz │
// ├─────────┼─────┼─────┤
// │  row0   │ 10  │ 50  │
// │  row1   │ 20  │ 60  │
// │  row2   │ 30  │ 70  │
// │  row3   │ 40  │ 80  │
// └─────────┴─────┴─────┘
// Shape: [ 4, 2 ]

// note that `x` and `y` both have a "bar" column; so the values in "bar" in
// `x` will be inserted below the "bar" values in the original `DataFrame`
x.append(y).print()
// ┌─────────┬───────────┬─────┬───────────┐
// │ (index) │    foo    │ bar │    baz    │
// ├─────────┼───────────┼─────┼───────────┤
// │  row0   │     2     │  5  │ undefined │
// │  row1   │     3     │  6  │ undefined │
// │  row2   │     4     │  7  │ undefined │
// │  row3   │ undefined │ 10  │    50     │
// │  row4   │ undefined │ 20  │    60     │
// │  row5   │ undefined │ 30  │    70     │
// │  row6   │ undefined │ 40  │    80     │
// └─────────┴───────────┴─────┴───────────┘
// Shape: [ 7, 3 ]
```

The same sort of thing happens when the `axis` is 1, except that in that case, the _rows_ of the `DataFrame` objects are matched up as one is appended to the other.

### `DataFrame.apply(fn, axis=0)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` in which `fn` has been applied to each column `Series` (if `axis` is 0) or row `Series` (if `axis` is 1).

### `DataFrame.assign(name, values)` or `DataFrame.assign(obj)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` to which new values have been assigned in new columns. In the first form, a column `name` and a corresponding list of `values` are passed into the method, and the returned `DataFrame` will contain the original data plus the new column. In the second form, the object passed as `obj` should contain key-value pairs representing column names and their corresponding values. The second form, therefore, is more convenient when assigning multiple columns at once.

### `DataFrame.clear()`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` in which all of the values have been replaced with `undefined` (but the shape is still the same).

### `DataFrame.copy()`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame`.

### `DataFrame.dropColumns(columns)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` from which the given columns have been dropped. A whole number, a string, or an array of whole numbers or strings can be passed as `columns`.

### `DataFrame.dropRows(rows)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` from which the given rows have been dropped. A whole number, a string, or an array of whole numbers or strings can be passed as `rows`.

### `DataFrame.dropMissing(axis=0, condition="any", threshold=0)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` from which rows or columns containing missing values (i.e., undefined or null values) have been dropped if `condition` is met or the `threshold` is exceeded. The `condition` isn't a boolean as you might expect; instead, it's a string from `["any", "all", "none"]`. If the `condition` is "any", then _any_ missing values in a row or column will cause that row or column to be dropped. If the condition is "all", then a row or column will be dropped only if _all_ of its values are missing. In the above two cases, the `threshold` value isn't considered. But if the `threshold` is set to a value greater than 0, then `condition` will automatically be set to "none", and then a row or column will be dropped only of the number of missing values it contains exceeds the `threshold`. If `axis` is 0, then rows are dropped; and if `axis` is 1, then columns are dropped.

### `DataFrame.dropNaN(axis=0, condition="any", threshold=0)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` from which rows or columns containing NaN values have been dropped if `condition` is met or the `threshold` is exceeded. The `condition` isn't a boolean as you might expect; instead, it's a string from `["any", "all", "none"]`. If the `condition` is "any", then _any_ missing values in a row or column will cause that row or column to be dropped. If the condition is "all", then a row or column will be dropped only if _all_ of its values are missing. In the above two cases, the `threshold` value isn't considered. But if the `threshold` is set to a value greater than 0, then `condition` will automatically be set to "none", and then a row or column will be dropped only of the number of missing values it contains exceeds the `threshold`. If `axis` is 0, then rows are dropped; and if `axis` is 1, then columns are dropped.

### `DataFrame.drop(rows, columns)`

Returns of a copy of the original `DataFrame` from which the given `rows` and `columns` have been dropped. If you don't want to drop any rows, then pass `null` as that argument; and the same applies for columns. The `rows` and `columns` values can be whole numbers, strings, or arrays of whole numbers or strings.

### `DataFrame.filter(fn, axis=0)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` with rows or columns filtered out by `fn`. If `axis` is 0, then row `Series` objects will be passed into `fn`; and if `axis` is 1, then column `Series` objects will be passed into `fn`. If `fn` returns `false` for any input, then that input will be filtered out.

### `DataFrame.getDummies(columns)`

Returns a `DataFrame` containing one-hot encodings of the given `columns` in the original `DataFrame`. Note that in most applications of one-hot encodings, if a column contains _n_ unique values, then (_n_ - 1) columns will be returned. But this implementation returns _n_ columns just in case you have other uses for it. But dropping the extra column is easy with the `drop` method.

### `DataFrame.getSubsetByIndices(rowIndices, colIndices)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` only containing the rows and columns specified by `rowIndices` and `colIndices`, where those values are one of null, whole numbers, or arrays of whole numbers. This method is mostly used internally, though you can use it if you want; the easier way is just to use the `get` method.

### `DataFrame.getSubsetByNames(rowNames, colNames)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` only containing the rows and columns specified by `rowNames` and `colNames`, where those values are one of null, strings, or arrays of strings. This method is mostly used internally, though you can use it if you want; the easier way is just to use the `get` method.

### `DataFrame.get(rows, columns)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` only containing the rows and columns specified by `rows` and `columns`, where those values are one of null, whole numbers, strings, or arrays of whole numbers or strings.

### `DataFrame.join(x, axis=0)`

Same as `DataFrame.append`.

### `DataFrame.onHotEncode(columns)`

Identical to `DataFrame.getDummies`.

### `DataFrame.print()`

Prints the `DataFrame` to the console in a pretty way and then returns the `DataFrame`.

### `DataFrame.resetIndex()`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` in which the list of row names have been reverted to their original values, like "row0", "row1", etc.

### `DataFrame.shuffle(axis=0)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` in which the rows (if `axis` is 0) or columns (if `axis` is 1) have been put in a random order.

### `DataFrame.sort(columns, directions)` or `DataFrame.sort(fn, directions)`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` sorted by the given `columns` or `fn`. The `columns` argument can be a whole number, string, or array of whole numbers or strings can be given. The `fn` argument can be a comparison function that will compare `Series` against each other. By default, all of the columns will be sorted in ascending order; but to override this behavior, pass a boolean value, array of boolean values, or array of "ascending" / "descending" string values as `directions`.

### `DataFrame.toJSONString()`

Returns a stringified copy of the original `DataFrame` in JSON format. By default, the JSON object will have a structure like this:

```json
{
  "row0": {
    "col0": 5,
    "col1": 7,
    "col2": 9,
    ...
  },

  "row1": {
    ...
  },

  "row2": {
    ...
  },

  ...
}
```

However, the nesting can be reversed (putting the column names at the shallowest level and the row names at the next level) by setting `axis` to 1.

### `DataFrame.saveAsJSON(path, axis=0)`

Writes the `DataFrame` to disk at `path` in JSON format. See the `DataFrame.toJSONString` method for more info about the structure of the object written to disk and the meaning of the `axis` value. In a browser, only a filename need be passed as `path` since the file will just be downloaded in whatever way the browser usually downloads files. In Node, however, a filesystem path (relative or absolute) must be passed as `path`.

### `DataFrame.toDetailedObject(axis=0)`

Returns an object in the format described above in the `DataFrame.toJSONString` method. See that method for more info about the structure of the returned object and the meaning of the `axis` value.

### `DataFrame.toObject()`

Returns an object in which they keys are column names and the values are the arrays of values associated with each column name.

### `DataFrame.transpose()`

Returns a copy of the original `DataFrame` in which the values (and row names and column names) have been flipped across the main diagonal (from top left to bottom right).

<hr />

## `decycle(x)`

Returns a copy of `x` in which cyclic references are replaced with strings indicating the path through the object to the referenced value. In this context, the path `"/"` refers to the root object (`x`), and a path like `"/foo/bar"` refers to `x.foo.bar`.

For example:

```js
const person = { name: "Josh" }
person.self = person
console.log(person)
// <ref *1> { name: 'Josh', self: [Circular *1] }

const { decycle } = require("@jrc03c/js-math-tools")
console.log(decycle(person))
// { name: 'Josh', self: '<reference to "/">' }
```

Here's an example of what the path might look like in a more deeply nested circular reference:

```js
const util = require("util")
const x = { foo: { bar: { baz: { hello: "world" } } } }
x.foo.bar.baz.parent = x.foo.bar

console.log(util.inspect(x, { depth: Infinity, compact: false }))
// {
//   foo: {
//     bar: <ref *1> {
//       baz: {
//         hello: 'world',
//         parent: [Circular *1]
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }

console.log(util.inspect(decycle(x), { depth: Infinity, compact: false }))
// {
//   foo: {
//     bar: {
//       baz: {
//         hello: 'world',
//         parent: '<reference to "/foo/bar">'
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }
```

<hr />

## `diff(a, b)`

Returns the difference between `set(a)` and `set(b)`; i.e., the set of values that are included in `a` and _not_ included in `b`. Note that the order of the arguments matters. If `a` and `b` aren't identical, then `diff(a, b)` won't necessarily produce the same results as `diff(b, a)`. For example:

```js
const a = [2, 3, 4]
const b = [4, 5, 6]

console.log(diff(a, b))
// [2, 3]

console.log(diff(b, a))
// [5, 6]
```

## `distance(a, b)`

Returns the 2-norm (i.e., the Euclidean distance) between `a` and `b`. And though `a` and `b` can have any shape, they must have the _same_ shape as each other (unless either is an individual numbers). For example:

```js
console.log(distance([3, 4], 0))
// 5

console.log(distance([3, 4], [5, 6, 7]))
// error!
```

## `divide(a, b)`

Returns the result of `a` divided by `b`.

## `dot(a, b)`

Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`, which can be 1- or 2-dimensional arrays, `Series` instances, or `DataFrame` instances.

## `dropMissing(x)`

Returns a copy of `x` without any undefined or null values. Note that dropping values from nested arrays and `DataFrame` instances may result in jagged arrays.

## `dropMissingPairwise(a, b)`

Returns copies of `a` and `b` without any undefined or null values. Note that `a` and `b` must have the same shape. Also note that dropping values from nested arrays and `DataFrame` instances may result in jagged arrays.

## `dropNaN(x)`

Returns a copy of `x` without any non-numerical values. Note that dropping values from nested arrays and `DataFrame` instances may result in jagged arrays.

## `dropNaNPairwise(a, b)`

Returns copies of arbitrarily nested arrays `a` and `b` without any non-numerical values. Note that `a` and `b` must have the same shape. Also note that dropping values from nested arrays and `DataFrame` instances may result in jagged arrays.

## `dropUndefined(x)`

Identical to `dropMissing`.

## `exp(x)`

Returns _e_ to the power(s) of `x`.

## `factorial(x)`

Returns the factorial(s) of `x`.

## `find(x, fn)`

Returns the first value that causes the `fn` function to evaluate to true when evaluated on every item in `x`. Note that `x` can be an arbitrarily nested array (or `Series` or `DataFrame`) _or_ an object. All of those types are searched to any depth.

## `findAll(x, fn)`

Returns all of the values that cause the `fn` function to evaluate to true when evaluated on every item in `x`. Note that `x` can be an arbitrarily nested array (or `Series` or `DataFrame`) _or_ an object. All of those types are searched to any depth.

## `flatten(x)`

Returns a 1-dimensional copy of `x`.

## `float(x)`

Returns `x` converted to floating point number(s).

## `floor(x)`

Returns the floor(s) of `x`.

## `identity(n)`

Returns an identity matrix of size `n` ✕ `n`.

## `indexOf(x, matcher)`

Returns the index of the first value that matches the `matcher`, where `matcher` is either a function or any other value type. If `matcher` is a function, then `indexOf` returns the first value for which the `matcher` function returns `true` when evaluated on all values of `x`. If `matcher` is a value of any other type, then the `indexOf` function returns the index of the first value that is equal to `matcher` (where equality is tested using the `isEqual` function, meaning that even non-identical objects can be considered to be equal if all of their members are equal). Note that `x` can be an arbitrarily nested array (or `Series` or `DataFrame`) _or_ an object. All of those types are searched to any depth. If `x` is an object, then the returned index represents the path down through the keys and values of the object to the relevant value. Also note that _keys_ of objects are not evaluated; only an object's _values_ are evaluated.

## `inferType(x)`

Given a vector `x`, returns an object with these properties:

- `type` = one of these:
  - boolean
  - date
  - null
  - number
  - object
  - string
- `values` = all of the values in `x` cast into the inferred type

Although you can pass `DataFrame` instances or other (>1)-dimensional arrays into this function, be aware that any data will be flattened into a vector before its type is inferred.

### Inferrable types

The inferrable types listed above correspond roughly to the main JS data types, but there are a few exceptions.

First, "date" is not a data type in JS. There are `Date` objects, of course, but `typeof new Date()` returns "object". Since dates are commonly stored in datasets and because they come with their own particular set of challenges, I've set these apart as their own data type so that they won't be conflated with other kinds of objects.

Second, arrays are not among the inferrable types because `x` is assumed to be a vector, and allowing `x` to be potentially nested makes it difficult to determine whether `x` is supposed to be a vector, matrix, tensor, mixed data structure, etc. Thus any arrays with more than 1 dimension (or `DataFrame` instances) that are passed into this function will be flattened before their types are inferred.

### Alternate values

It's pretty common for datasets to contain boolean-ish and null-ish values, by which I mean string values like "yes", "no", "NaN", "NONE", "undefined", "NA", etc., or even empty strings. Those values are sort of like boolean or null values, but they're not always consistent or suitable for immediate inference by something like the `JSON.parse` function. Therefore, the `inferType` function tries to look for such values. For example, if it encounters a string value like "YES", it counts that value as a boolean, _not_ as a string! In fact, counting a value as a string is the function's very last resort since it's so common for values to be included accidentally as strings. For example, if you use a library like [papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/) to read a CSV file from disk, then the returned data may just be a matrix of strings and nothing more; i.e., it's probably pretty common for such libraries to avoid making inferences about the data, leaving such work up to the user. So, when the `inferType` function encounters a string value, it does its best to cast it into any other data type first; but if it fails to find any suitable type, it gives up and assumes that the value is just a plain ol' string. Here are the lists of boolean-ish and null-ish values that are parsed as booleans and nulls respectively (accounting for case sensitivity, of course):

Nulls:

- ""
- "n/a"
- "na"
- "nan"
- "none"
- "null"
- "undefined"

Booleans:

- "true"
- "false"
- "yes"
- "no"

This function doesn't cover every possible edge case, of course; it should probably only be expected to work on an average dataset. If your data is especially unusual, please consider manually inferring types some other way.

## `int(x)`

Returns `x` converted to integer(s).

## `intersect(a, b, c, ...)`

Returns the intersection of the given arrays, `Series` instances, or `DataFrame` instances; i.e., the set of values that are in _all_ of the given items.

## `inverse(x)`

Returns the inverse of a square matrix or `DataFrame` `x`.

## `isArray(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is an array; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isBoolean(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is a boolean value; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isBrowser()`

Returns `true` if called in a browser environment (whether in the main thread or in a Web Worker) or `false` in a Node environment. It's definitely not foolproof and can probably easily be fooled by configuring certain built-in global variables. But as long as you're not modifying those variables (e.g. `window` in the browser), it should be fairly accurate.

Also, this obviously isn't a math function, but I'm including it here because (1) it's a super useful utility function, and (2) I needed it for this library anyway, so why not add it to the public API?

## `isDataFrame(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is a `DataFrame`; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isEqual(a, b)`

Returns `true` if `a` and `b` are equal; otherwise, returns `false`. Equality in the context of this function means that the two items are _functionally_ the same, even if they're not literally the same object in memory. For example:

```js
const a = { hello: "world" }
const b = { hello: "world" }
console.log(isEqual(a, b))
// true
```

In the above example, `a` and `b` are not literally the same object in memory, but they are nevertheless functionally equivalent; i.e., they have all the same properties, methods, values, etc. Note that there may be some ways in which this function can be tricked, especially as regards non-enumerable properties. But generally speaking, if an object has the same enumerable properties, methods, values, etc., then `isEqual` will return `true`.

## `isFunction(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is a function; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isJagged(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is a jagged array; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isNested(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is a nested array; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isNumber(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is a number; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isObject(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is an object; otherwise, returns `false`. Weirdly, in JS, `null` is considered an object (which you can see for yourself with `typeof null`). But for the purposes of this function, `null` is _not_ considered to be an object in the usual sense; i.e., `isObject(null)` will return `false`.

## `isSeries(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is a `Series`; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isString(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is a string; otherwise, returns `false`.

## `isUndefined(x)`

Returns `true` if `x` is undefined or null; otherwise, returns `false`. Note that NaN values are considered to be defined.

## `lerp(a, b, f)`

Returns the linear interpolation from `a` to `b` at fraction `f`.

## `log(x)`

Returns the natural log(s) of `x`.

## `MathError(message)`

This class only exists because (1) I wanted to make it clear when errors where coming specifically from this library, and (2) I wanted to color-code the errors in the command line. Those are the only two ways in which `MathError` differs from `Error`.

## `max(x)`

Returns the maximum value in `x`.

## `mean(x)`

Returns the average value in `x`.

## `median(x)`

Returns the median value in `x`.

## `min(x)`

Returns the minimum value in `x`.

## `mode(x)`

Returns the mode(s) of `x`. Note that an array will always be returned since there can be potentially be multiple modes in `x`.

## `multiply(a, b, c, ...)`

Returns the product of the given values. See the note under `product` for a description of how `multiply` and `scale` differ from `product`.

## `ndarray(shape)`

Returns an _n_-dimensional array where `shape` is an array of whole numbers. For example, `ndarray([5, 10])` would return a 5 ✕ 10 matrix.

## `normal(shape)`

Returns an _n_-dimensional array of normally-distributed random numbers where `shape` is undefined, null, or an array of whole numbers. If `shape` is undefined or null, then a single number will be returned; otherwise, an array will be returned.

## `ones(shape)`

Returns an _n_-dimensional array of 1s where `shape` is an array of whole numbers.

## `permutations(x, r)`

Given an arbitrarily nested array `x`, returns all possible permutations of `r` items from `x`. Note that any nesting of `x` will be ignored — i.e., `x` will be "flattened" into a 1-dimensional array before getting the permutations — so it won't be possible with this function to get permutations of arrays.

## `product(x)`

Returns the product of all of the values in arbitrarily nested array `x`. Note that `product` differs slightly in functionality from `multiply` and `scale` in that `product` _only_ accepts arrays, `Series` instances, and `DataFrame` instances. Just as you might want to get the `sum` of values in an array, so you might also want to get the `product` of values in an array. If you want to multiply values by each other (whether those values are numbers, arrays, `Series` instances, or `DataFrame` instances), you'll want to use the `multiply` or `scale` functions.

## `pow(a, b)`

Returns `a` to the power(s) of `b`.

## `print(x)`

Prints `x` to the console. For the most part, this function is basically the same as `console.log`. The only additional functionality it provides is printing `DataFrame` and `Series` objects nicely (most of the time).

## `random(shape)`

Returns an _n_-dimensional array of random numbers in the range [0, 1] where `shape` is undefined, null, or an array of whole numbers. If `shape` is undefined or null, then a single number will be returned; otherwise, an array will be returned.

## `range(a, b, step=1)`

Returns an array of numbers in the range [`a`, `b`) incremented by `step`.

## `remap(x, a, b, c, d)`

Returns `x` remapped from the range [`a`, `b`] to the range [`c`, `d`]. For example, `remap(2, 0, 10, 0, 100)` would return 20.

## `reshape(x, shape)`

Returns `x` reshaped into shape `shape`.

## `reverse(x)`

Returns a reversed copy of `x`. Only reverses at the shallowest level.

## `round(x)`

Returns the next lowest or highest integer(s) when `x`.

## `scale(a, b, c, ...)`

Identical to `multiply`.

## `seed(n)`

Seeds the PRNG with `n`, an integer.

<hr />

## `Series(x)`

The `Series` class is similar to pandas' [`Series`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html). They at least represent the same kind of data (named 1-dimensional arrays), though they probably differ in many of their members.

The constructor for a `Series` can optionally receive a value `x`, which can be any of these:

- another `Series`
- a 1-dimensional array
- an object whose lone key-value pair represents the name and values, respectively

### `Series.values`

A 1-dimensional array containing the values held by the `Series`. Technically, `values` is a getter-setter pair that stores its data in a hidden `_values` property. While it's possible to set the `_values` property directly, this is strongly discouraged because it bypasses sanity checks on the data, like checking that new data is 1-dimensional, etc.

### `Series.index`

An array of names for each value. If you like, you can think of them as "row" or "column" names, even though there technically aren't any rows or columns in a `Series`. If you `get` a single row or column from a `DataFrame`, then the returned value will be a `Series` whose `index` represents the column names or row names, respectively, of the originating `DataFrame`.

Technically, `index` is a getter-setter pair that stores its data in a hidden `_index` property. While it's possible to set the `_index` property directly, this is strongly discouraged because it bypasses sanity checks on the data, like checking to make sure that the length of the new `index` array is the same as the length of the `values` array, etc.

### `Series.name`

The name of the `Series` object. If you `get` a single row or column out of a `DataFrame`, then the returned value will be a `Series` whose name represents the row name or column name, respectively, of the values in the originating `DataFrame`.

### `Series.shape`

A read-only array containing only a single value: the length of the `values` array.

### `Series.length`

A read-only value representing the length of the `values` array.

### `Series.isEmpty`

A read-only boolean value that is `true` if the `Series` contains no data or `false` otherwise.

### `Series.append(x)`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` with `x` appended to it. A single value, an array of values, or another `Series` can be passed as `x`.

### `Series.apply(fn)`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` with `fn` applied to every value.

### `Series.concat(x)`

Same as `Series.append`.

### `Series.dropMissing()`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` without null or undefined values.

### `Series.dropNaN()`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` without NaN values.

### `Series.filter(fn)`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` with only those values that return `true` when passed into function `fn`.

### `Series.getSubsetByIndices(indices)`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` containing only the values indicated by `indices`. A single whole number or an array of whole numbers can be passed as `indices`. This method is mostly used internally, though you can use it if you want; the easier way is just to use the `get` method.

### `Series.getSubsetByNames(names)`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` containing only the values indicated by `names`. A single string or an array of strings can be passed as `indices`. This method is mostly used internally, though you can use it if you want; the easier way is just to use the `get` method.

### `Series.get(selectors)`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` containing only the values indicated by `selectors`. A single whole number, a single string, or an array of whole numbers or strings can be passed as `selectors`.

### `Series.print()`

Prints the `Series` to the console in a pretty way, and then returns the `Series`.

### `Series.sortByIndex()`

Returns a copy of the original `Series` sorted by its index values.

### `Series.sort(fn, ascending=true)`

Returns a sorted copy of the original `Series`. If `fn` is undefined, then the returned copy will be sorted by its values; otherwise, the copy will be sorted by `fn`.

### `Series.toObject()`

Returns an object with this form:

```js
{
  [Series.name]: {
    [Series.index[0]]: Series.values[0],
    [Series.index[1]]: Series.values[1],
    ...
  }
}
```

<hr />

## `set(x)`

Returns the (unsorted) unique values in `x`.

## `shape(x)`

Returns the shape of `x`. If `x` is "smooth" (i.e., non-jagged), then the returned shape will be a 1-dimensional array; but if `x` is jagged, then the returned shape will be an array with a mix of numbers and sub-arrays. For example:

```js
const smooth = [
  [2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7],
]

console.log(shape(smooth))
// [ 2, 3 ]

const jagged = [2, [3, 4], 5]
console.log(shape(jagged))
// [ 3, [ undefined, 2, undefined ] ]
```

In the case of `smooth` above, the returned shape represents the number of rows and columns respectively; i.e., there are 2 rows and 3 columns. But instead of thinking of this shape as `[2 rows, 3 columns]`, we could also think of it as `[outer array length is 2, inner array length is 3]`. This way of thinking about it will hopefully clarify what's going on in the case of `jagged`.

In the case of `jagged`, the first part of the shape, 3, represents the length of the outer array. You can also think of it as having 3 "rows", but that might be a little confusing since we can see that not all of the items are actually rows; so thinking of 3 as the length of the outer array makes the most sense here, I think. If it helps, you can think of `jagged` as looking like this: `[?, ?, ?]`. Now, to get the second part of the shape, we need to figure out how long each inner array in `jagged` is. Well, the first item in `jagged` is 2, which isn't an array, and thus has a length of `undefined`; but the second item is `[3, 4]`, which is an array with length of 2; and the third item is 5, which isn't an array, and thus has a length of `undefined`.

If all of the items in `jagged` were arrays with length 2, then its shape would be `[3, 2]`. But because the inner "array" lengths don't all match up, a single number won't capture enough information about what `jagged` looks like on the inside; so instead we place an array in the second slot of the shape to indicate that each item has a different length.

## `shuffle(x)`

Returns a shuffled copy of `x`. Note that only the shallowest level of `x` is shuffled.

## `sign(x)`

Returns -1(s), 0(s), or 1(s) if `x` is less than 0, equal to 0 or greater than 0, respectively.

## `sin(s)`

Returns the sine(s) of `x`.

## `sort(x, fn)`

Sorts `x` by function `fn`. This function is identical to [`Array.prototype.sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) except that it does _not_ sort `x` in-place; instead it returns a sorted copy of `x`.

## `sqrt(x)`

Returns the square root(s) of `x`.

## `std(x)`

Returns the standard deviation of the values in `x`.

## `stdev(x)`

Identical to `std`.

## `subtract(a, b)`

Returns the difference of `a` and `b`.

## `sum(x)`

Returns the sum of all values in `x`. The difference between `add` and `sum` is that `sum` _only_ accepts arrays. In other words, use `add` when you want to add up multiple distinct values passed as arguments (where those arguments can be numbers, arrays, `Series` instances, or `DataFrame` instances); and use `sum` when you want to add up all of the values in a single array.

## `tan(x)`

Returns the tangent(s) of `x`.

## `time(fn)`

Identical to `timeSync`.

## `timeSync(fn)`

Returns the time in milliseconds that it takes for synchronous function `fn` to run.

## `timeAsync(fn)`

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to the time in milliseconds that it takes for asynchronous function `fn` to run.

## `transpose(x)`

Returns the transpose of a 1- or 2-dimensional array (or `Series` or `DataFrame`) `x`.

## `union(a, b, c, ...)`

Returns the union of the sets of values in the given items.

## `variance(x)`

Returns the variance of the values in `x`.

## `vectorize(fn)`

Returns a function that operates on individual values, arrays, `Series` instances, or `DataFrame` instances. It's a little like numpy's [`vectorize`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.vectorize.html) function except that numpy probably has a bunch of fancy optimizations that make vectorized operations very fast. In this library, though, no optimizations are applied; this function merely makes it easier for individual functions to operate on multiple types of data containers.

For example, the `Math.sin` function only accepts a single value. But by using the `vectorize` function, we can create a function that accepts either single values or arrays of values:

```js
const sin = vectorize(Math.sin)

console.log(sin(0))
// 0

const angles = [0, Math.PI / 4, Math.PI / 2]
console.log(sin(angles))
// [ 0, 0.7071067811865475, 1 ]
```

This also works when the function requires multiple arguments. For example, the `add` function in this library accepts two arguments and has been passed through the `vectorize` function so that it accepts individual values or arrays of values:

```js
console.log(add(2, 3))
// 5

console.log(add([2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]))
// [ 7, 9, 11 ]

console.log(add(2, [5, 6, 7]))
// [ 7, 8, 9 ]

console.log(add([2, 3, 4], 5))
// [ 7, 8, 9 ]
```

At the moment, though, the function is pretty naive about the _shapes_ of the arrays; e.g., it'll throw an error in the `add` function if both arguments are arrays of differing shapes.

Finally, a vectorized function can also accept `Series` and `DataFrame` instances. When this happens, the function will try to return an object of the same type, if possible. For example, using the `add` function above to add a `Series` and a single number will result in a new `Series` with the same name and index as the original. But if two `Series` instances are passed into `add`, then a new `Series` will be returned that bears a default name and default index (since there's no obvious way to choose which `Series` name or index to prefer).

## `zeros(shape)`

Returns an _n_-dimensional array of 0s where `shape` is an array of whole numbers.

## `zip(a, b, c, ...)`

Returns a new array or new `DataFrame` in which the shallowest values of the given arrays (`a`, `b`, `c`, etc.) are stacked side-by-side. For example:

```js
const a = [2, 3, 4]
const b = [5, 6, 7, 8]
const c = zip(a, b)
console.log(c)
// [
//   [ 2, 5 ],
//   [ 3, 6 ],
//   [ 4, 7 ],
//   [ undefined, 8 ]
// ]
```

# Notes

## Jagged arrays

Note that for all of the above, "arbitrarily nested array" typically means a _non-jagged_ array. Jagged arrays (AKA "ragged" arrays) are arrays in which nested arrays have inconsistent lengths. For example, this — `[[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` — would be a jagged array because the sub-arrays have lengths 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Many of the above functions expect non-jagged arrays. (Is there a technical term for non-jagged arrays? Maybe "even" arrays? Or "smooth" arrays? I'll go with "smooth" for now.) Some of them may not throw an error when passed a jagged array, though; they may quietly do their work and return an unexpected result. For example, the `dropNaN` function will happily drop NaN values from nested arrays, potentially leaving them jagged as a result. I've tried to let the functions operate this way when it's not strictly necessary for them to operate on smooth arrays. When a smooth array is required, an error should be thrown if the function receives a jagged array instead.

## Random numbers

The PRNG (pseudo-random number generator) implemented in this library uses the [xoroshiro256++](https://prng.di.unimi.it/) algorithm, in case that matters to you. To seed the PRNG, pass a number into the `seed` function. Large integers tend to do better than small ones. The `random`, `normal`, and `shuffle` functions can all be seeded. For example:

```js
const { random, seed } = require("js-math-tools")

seed(230498349)
random(5)
// [
//   0.018838884276985594,
//   0.5304929121766935,
//   0.7364885210604148,
//   0.005920131518888056,
//   0.8434281063536071
// ]

seed(230498349)
random(5)
// [
//   0.018838884276985594,
//   0.5304929121766935,
//   0.7364885210604148,
//   0.005920131518888056,
//   0.8434281063536071
// ]
```

Do be aware, though, that there's no such thing in this library as having multiple PRNGs at the same time, each with different seeds. Instead, all of the randomization functions share the same seeding because they all share the same core `random` function.

# Troubleshooting

Note that in certain build setups, errors may be thrown when you try to import this library. The error message is usually: "Big integer literals are not available in the configured target environment". To be really honest, I have only the haziest of ideas about what this means or why it happens, but [this](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/859#issuecomment-1184696144) solution works for (e.g.) Vite and perhaps Svelte — though I haven't tried the latter. If you're not using Vite or Svelte, perhaps that solution will guide you in the right direction for whatever build setup you have. If you _do_ find solutions for other build setups, please let me know and I'll add them to this section.

# To do

- Add a method that makes it easy to merge `DataFrames` along a certain key. For example, it'd be nice to be able to merge multiple datasets that have a unique ID column with values that match across the sets.
- Add a simplex noise function.
- Convert to TS?
- Organize the files a little better? Right now, they're just in a big heap. It might be better, though, to classify them as randomization functions, statistics functions, etc.
- Work out a more coherent theory of when to return false / NaN / undefined / null values versus when to throw errors.
- Keep documentation up-to-date!
